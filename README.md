# STOP WATCH Web Application
## Overview

This project is a simple web-based stopwatch application. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer. The interface is minimalistic and user-friendly, making it easy to interact with the stopwatch.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the application to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Adds functionality to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the stopwatch.
- `index.css`: The CSS file that styles the stopwatch.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that provides the functionality for the stopwatch.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html
├── index.css
└── index.js
```

## HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file includes the main structure of the application. It has:

- A `div` element with an ID of `main` which contains the entire stopwatch interface.
- An `h1` element for the title "STOP WATCH".
- A `div` element with an ID of `stopwatch` that displays the timer.
- A `div` element with an ID of `buttom` that contains the control buttons: STOP, START, and RESET.
- A link to the external CSS file (`index.css`).
- A script tag to include the JavaScript file (`index.js`).


## CSS Styles (`index.css`)

The `index.css` file styles the elements to enhance the appearance of the stopwatch. This includes the layout, fonts, colors, and button styles.


## JavaScript Functionality (`index.js`)

The `index.js` file provides the necessary functions to control the stopwatch:

- `startStopwatch()`: Starts the timer.
- `stopStopwatch()`: Stops the timer.
- `resetStopwatch()`: Resets the timer to 00:00:00.



## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the **START** button to begin the stopwatch.
3. Click the **STOP** button to stop the stopwatch.
4. Click the **RESET** button to reset the stopwatch to `00:00:00`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can be further enhanced with additional features and styling as needed.
